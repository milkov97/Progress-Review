# Progress Review Preparation Repository

This repository was created as part of my role as a mentor in the [Telerik Academy](https://www.telerik.com) Python program. It contains resources and code snippets designed to help my group of 7 students prepare for their progress review.

## Contents

1. **Theoretical Questions**: In the "Theoretical Questions" directory, you'll find a collection of questions covering essential Python concepts. These questions were used to assess the students' theoretical knowledge.

2. **Code Snippets**:
   - **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: This directory contains code snippets related to object-oriented programming principles in Python. Students were encouraged to analyze and modify these snippets to test their understanding.
   - **Functions**: In this directory, you'll find code snippets related to Python functions, including common tasks and challenges.
   - **Collections**: Here, you can find code snippets and examples related to Python collections like lists, dictionaries, sets, and more.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide a resource for the students I mentored during the Python program at Telerik Academy. They used these materials to prepare for their progress review, which assessed their Python programming skills, theoretical knowledge, and problem-solving abilities.

## How to Use

- If you are one of my former students or an aspiring Python developer, feel free to explore the repository's contents.
- Review the theoretical questions to test your knowledge of Python concepts.
- Examine the code snippets to understand and practice key programming techniques.
